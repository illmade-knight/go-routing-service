# **Completed Refactor Summary**

This document summarizes the successful refactoring initiative to standardize the go-routing-service and harden its security. All planned tasks have been completed.

### **Phase 1: Standardization (Complete)**

The service's lifecycle and API components have been successfully refactored to use the standardized `go-microservice-base` library.

* **`BaseServer` Integration**: The `routingservice.Wrapper` now embeds `microservice.BaseServer`, replacing all custom HTTP server management.
* **Standardized Error Handling**: All API handlers now use `response.WriteJSONError` for consistent, structured JSON error responses.
* **Centralized Middleware**: All custom middleware has been removed in favor of the standardized JWT and CORS implementations from the base library.

### **Phase 2: Security Hardening (Complete)**

The critical sender spoofing vulnerability identified during the security audit has been resolved.

* **Sender Spoofing Vulnerability Fixed**: The `SendHandler` now correctly ignores any client-provided `SenderID` and overwrites it with the trusted user ID from the JWT context.
* **Unit Tests Updated**: A new unit test has been added to `routing_handlers_test.go` that explicitly verifies the `SenderID` is overwritten, confirming the fix is effective and preventing regressions.
