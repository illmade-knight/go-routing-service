# **Completed Refactor Summary**

This document summarizes the successful refactoring initiative to standardize the go-routing-service and harden its security. All planned tasks have been completed.

### **Phase 1: Standardization (Complete)**

The service's lifecycle and API components have been successfully refactored to use the standardized go-microservice-base library.

* **BaseServer Integration**: The routingservice.Wrapper now embeds microservice.BaseServer, replacing all custom HTTP server management.
* **Standardized Error Handling**: All API handlers now use response.WriteJSONError for consistent, structured JSON error responses.
* **Centralized Middleware**: All custom middleware has been removed in favor of the standardized JWT and CORS implementations from the base library.

### **Phase 2: Security Hardening (Complete)**

The service has been updated to align with the latest security standards of the microservice ecosystem.

* **Sender Spoofing Vulnerability Fixed**: The SendHandler now correctly ignores any client-provided SenderID and overwrites it with the trusted user ID from the JWT context.
* **Unit Tests Updated**: A new unit test has been added to routing\_handlers\_test.go that explicitly verifies the SenderID is overwritten, confirming the fix is effective and preventing regressions.
* **Asymmetric JWT Validation (RS256)**: The service's authentication middleware has been upgraded to use the NewJWKSAuthMiddleware from the base library. It no longer uses an insecure shared secret and instead validates tokens by fetching the public key from the identity service.
